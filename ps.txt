I had to take 3 buses to commute to high school and one way commute usually took 2 hours.
Despite the educational and financial barriers, I secured high merit positions and scholarships in prestigeous universities of pakistan and choosed UET's electrical engineering program because of highly qualified faculty and government funded scholarship. 

In university, I joined a number of student socities but I actively participated in STEM5, an non-profit oragnization which aims to provide interactive science lessons to 
under-priviliged kids. My biggest motivation to give the under-priviliged children proper science lessons which I missed in my primary school because of lack of science 
facilities. I delivered lectures to grade 5 students at Government Primary School Singhpura for a year.
